
FlowJS is a library for creating declarative user interfaces for PWAs.

The core library handles the components and rerenders only parts that have changed upon state changes in the application. 
Every component is self contained and manages itself. This is the idea of FlowJS. To have a way to declare UI that is reactive,
without all of the boilerplate and bs that comes with react or angular such as compiling from typescript to JS anyways, NPM packages 
and the entire ecosystem around them. The ecosystem for building applications has become fully retarded, and im trying to change that. 
Now all you need is to transpile the JSX files, which is not even needed in the first place. 
It also is a way for web devs to create PWAs and reuse components they already have. This way we never have to write a button or input element twice





This directory is all you need to start a FlowJS application. You just start writing components in the /components directory and you can include them in the Application.js file, which is your main entry point of the application.
